       "      <td>Our stay at this rental was unfortunately tainted by a terrible miscommunication and extremely rude and hostile cleaning crew. Obviously we know the times we’re currently living in. There is a pandemic that is ramping up again and my family and I chose to stay in this rental house instead of a hotel for extra safety, no contact with people outside our family, and overall social distancing to make it a relaxing, comfortable vacation. On our second to last day, my wife and I decided to contact the hosts of this rental (Steve and Monique) to ask if we might be able to get a late check out. I used the phone number that was listed on the Airbnb rental page, which I believe is Monique’s. We didn’t get a response for quite some time, so I texted the phone number that had sent the booking confirmation and again didn’t get a response. Next, I contacted another number I found associated with this rental and someone replied and said to contact Monique. When Monique finally responded about 8 hours later, we were pleased to find out that she did give us a late check out for 1pm instead of 10am. We were thrilled! That meant we would have another morning at the beach before packing up and leaving. That morning, my family and I went to the beach and then went back to the house around 10:15am to find a note on the door from what we assumed were the cleaning crew, stating that check out was at 10am and they would be back in 30 minutes. When we opened the door we found bags of cleaning supplies, which means they had already been in the house, contaminating our “safe space”. We wrote them a note on the same piece of paper stating that we were given a late check out at 1pm, thank you! We did not want to have to communicate with them face to face due to covid, so we hoped that the note would suffice. We were very wrong. At 10:30am we heard the door being unlocked and a cleaning lady yelling “hello!”. We were panicked as not only did they ignore the note but they had the audacity to let themselves in while we were clearly still in the house! My wife went out to greet them and there were two people, a man and a woman, unmasked, letting themselves in and not stopping when they saw us. My wife immediately told them “we have a late check out!” and the woman replied, “well, no you don’t, no one told me that and we have to get in here and clean.” The man went into the kitchen and started going through the fridge and touching our food!! Then he headed to the bathroom and started collecting towels! We weren’t packed up AT ALL and had planned to shower before leaving! I told the woman (who said her name was Virginia) that we contacted the hosts and they granted us a late check out and she said, well they’re not the owners, you can keep packing while we start cleaning. My wife ushered our daughter into one of the bedrooms to keep themselves away from the cleaning people since they were still unmasked even though my whole family were scrambling to get ours on as quickly as possible. I tried to reason with them while everyone else hid in the rooms but they would not listen! Finally my wife came out of the room, our 3 year old crying hysterically because of the panic ensuing, and yelled at them to GET OUT! THERE IS A PANDEMIC AND THEY CANNOT BE IN THIS HOUSE WHILE WE ARE STILL IN THE HOUSE! GET OUT!! How dare they endanger my family without a care because, what, they had a schedule to keep? She was on a power trip? A miscommunication between host and cleaning crew? NONE OF THESE REASONS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO PUT MY FAMILY IN DANGER OF CONTRACTING THE VIRUS!!!!!! Finally after yelling at them, they left and said, “you have 30 minutes to get out and we’re coming back!” AGAIN, I told her, “we contacted the people in charge and we got a late check out!!!”  She responded, “I’m the manager!” ???? I have no idea who this woman is or who the owner is. All I know is that we rented the house from the hosts, Steve and Monique, and the host, Monique, granted us a late check out. End of story. Everything else is irrelevant. I cannot believe we were treated this way and were forced to rush out of the house in fear that the cleaning crew would come back and continue harassing us and putting us in danger. We were all in shock and have never EVER had this problem with any other rental we’ve stayed at. Under normal circumstances, this would have just been dealing with a terribly rude cleaning lady and a miscommunication between host and other staff. In this case, my family was put in danger as these people came into the house without masks on and refused to leave for several minutes in the middle of a pandemic. The exact reason we decided to stay in a rental house was to avoid this. This was by far the worst experience we’ve ever had with an Airbnb.</td>\n",

       "397847  Our stay at this rental was unfortunately tainted by a terrible miscommunication and extremely rude and hostile cleaning crew. Obviously we know the times we’re currently living in. There is a pandemic that is ramping up again and my family and I chose to stay in this rental house instead of a hotel for extra safety, no contact with people outside our family, and overall social distancing to make it a relaxing, comfortable vacation. On our second to last day, my wife and I decided to contact the hosts of this rental (Steve and Monique) to ask if we might be able to get a late check out. I used the phone number that was listed on the Airbnb rental page, which I believe is Monique’s. We didn’t get a response for quite some time, so I texted the phone number that had sent the booking confirmation and again didn’t get a response. Next, I contacted another number I found associated with this rental and someone replied and said to contact Monique. When Monique finally responded about 8 hours later, we were pleased to find out that she did give us a late check out for 1pm instead of 10am. We were thrilled! That meant we would have another morning at the beach before packing up and leaving. That morning, my family and I went to the beach and then went back to the house around 10:15am to find a note on the door from what we assumed were the cleaning crew, stating that check out was at 10am and they would be back in 30 minutes. When we opened the door we found bags of cleaning supplies, which means they had already been in the house, contaminating our “safe space”. We wrote them a note on the same piece of paper stating that we were given a late check out at 1pm, thank you! We did not want to have to communicate with them face to face due to covid, so we hoped that the note would suffice. We were very wrong. At 10:30am we heard the door being unlocked and a cleaning lady yelling “hello!”. We were panicked as not only did they ignore the note but they had the audacity to let themselves in while we were clearly still in the house! My wife went out to greet them and there were two people, a man and a woman, unmasked, letting themselves in and not stopping when they saw us. My wife immediately told them “we have a late check out!” and the woman replied, “well, no you don’t, no one told me that and we have to get in here and clean.” The man went into the kitchen and started going through the fridge and touching our food!! Then he headed to the bathroom and started collecting towels! We weren’t packed up AT ALL and had planned to shower before leaving! I told the woman (who said her name was Virginia) that we contacted the hosts and they granted us a late check out and she said, well they’re not the owners, you can keep packing while we start cleaning. My wife ushered our daughter into one of the bedrooms to keep themselves away from the cleaning people since they were still unmasked even though my whole family were scrambling to get ours on as quickly as possible. I tried to reason with them while everyone else hid in the rooms but they would not listen! Finally my wife came out of the room, our 3 year old crying hysterically because of the panic ensuing, and yelled at them to GET OUT! THERE IS A PANDEMIC AND THEY CANNOT BE IN THIS HOUSE WHILE WE ARE STILL IN THE HOUSE! GET OUT!! How dare they endanger my family without a care because, what, they had a schedule to keep? She was on a power trip? A miscommunication between host and cleaning crew? NONE OF THESE REASONS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO PUT MY FAMILY IN DANGER OF CONTRACTING THE VIRUS!!!!!! Finally after yelling at them, they left and said, “you have 30 minutes to get out and we’re coming back!” AGAIN, I told her, “we contacted the people in charge and we got a late check out!!!”  She responded, “I’m the manager!” ???? I have no idea who this woman is or who the owner is. All I know is that we rented the house from the hosts, Steve and Monique, and the host, Monique, granted us a late check out. End of story. Everything else is irrelevant. I cannot believe we were treated this way and were forced to rush out of the house in fear that the cleaning crew would come back and continue harassing us and putting us in danger. We were all in shock and have never EVER had this problem with any other rental we’ve stayed at. Under normal circumstances, this would have just been dealing with a terribly rude cleaning lady and a miscommunication between host and other staff. In this case, my family was put in danger as these people came into the house without masks on and refused to leave for several minutes in the middle of a pandemic. The exact reason we decided to stay in a rental house was to avoid this. This was by far the worst experience we’ve ever had with an Airbnb.   \n",
